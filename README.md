works in interactive mode:
=======
Usage
How to start the interpreter: First, we clone this repo:

$ git clone https://github.com/aliceada96/AirBnB_clone.git
$
Then we cd into AirBnb directory:

$ cd AirBnB
$
We can start the command interpreter interactively:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
To exit the console we can use the command quit or ctrl + D

(hbnb) quit
$
To get the available list of commands we can enter 'help' onto the CLI.

(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
We can get more information on a command e.g.,

(hbnb) help count
Print number of objects from class.
(hbnb)
We can create an instance of a class, for example:

(hbnb) create BaseModel
f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1
(hbnb)
Inspect an instance of a class:

(hbnb) show BaseModel f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1
[BaseModel] (f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1) ({'id': 'f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 15, 21, 27, 18, 991998), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 15, 21, 27, 18, 992046)})


(hbnb)
Update an instance of a class with various attributes:

(hbnb) update BaseModel f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1 name bonii
(hbnb) show BaseModel f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1
[BaseModel] (f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1) ({'id': 'f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 15, 21, 27, 18, 991998), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 15, 21, 28, 46, 959895), 'name': 'bobii'})
(hbnb)
Delete an instance of a class:

(hbnb) destroy BaseModel f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1
(hbnb) show BaseModel f8284b8a-27fd-413e-bc0f-e20ae89c17b1
